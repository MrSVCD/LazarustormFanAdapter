## Instructions
"Inlet Flat.stl" and "Inlet Tall Center.stl" only really works on the fan
position where the SD card cutout is because of space constraints.
"Tall Side.stl" works in both fan positions.

If either of the Tall versions of the fan adapter is used in SD card fan 
position it is considerably harder to change the SD card but the result is a 
more compact package over all.

## Printing
All prints should be able to be printed without need for supports in the
orientation the prints are in the files.

## Building
The Build.sh script requires bash and OpenSCAD.

This script is for my convenience and is not adapted to be run on anything other
than my own machines. Look at it before you run it.
