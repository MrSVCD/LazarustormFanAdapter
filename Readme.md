## Instructions

"Inlet Flat.stl" and "Inlet Tall Center.stl" only really works on the fan
position where the SD card cutout is becaouse of space constraints.
"Tall Side.stl" works in both fan positions.

If either of the Tall versions of the fan adapter is used in SD card fan 
position it is considrable harder to change the SD card but is a more compact
package over all.
